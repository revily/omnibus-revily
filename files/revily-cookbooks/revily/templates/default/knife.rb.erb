# To use this file, put it in a ".chef" directory at the top of your
# chef-repo. Then make sure your username is set (see the below comment),
# and that your keyfiles (both your user key and the validation key if
# you want to bootstrap) are in the .chef directory as well.
#

# Set your username here. We assume your username is a fine default.
#
# Make sure your private key is in the .chef directory, and named 
# 'username.pem', where username is, of course, whatever you set
# the below value to.
